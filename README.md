# Github Discussions Crawler and Slack Publisher [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/qualiton/github-discussions-crawler/tree/master.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/qualiton/github-discussions-crawler/tree/master)

Using [Github Team Discussion](https://blog.github.com/2017-11-20-introducing-team-discussions/) is an excellent way of promoting team collaboration. It can be used for [Architecture Decision Records](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/lightweight-architecture-decision-records), team meeting memos, RFCs.

[Slack](https://slack.com/) is the best team collaboration tool out in the market. It excels with huge number of integration capabilities.

Github Discussions Crawler marries both of the worlds by publishing discussion events to a slack channel. It uses [Github API V3](https://developer.github.com/v3/) and [Slack Incoming Webhooks](https://api.slack.com/incoming-webhooks) to the integration.
